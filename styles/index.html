    <p><Font size =6>Hello Guys, My name is Bryce and I am from Meridian Idaho. I am currently majoring in computer science and looking at going into cyber security.
        On most of the days when i'm not busy I like to play tennis or annoy my roomates. I am 18 almost turning 19 so as of right now I am not married.
        I have had a bunch of summer jobs but nothing to impactfull that will help me in my future carrer. The thing I love most is how most of the teachers
        are layed back and really nice. The degree that I am currently trying to persue is a bachlors in computer science.</p>
    <p>The Advantages I see that this class can over me is moreinsight on how websites are created. I think just understanding a function of soemthing can cause you
        to have more interactive conversations with family and peers. I am taking this course because I feel like web design will be start being taught to the younger generation
        more and more and I would want some backround knoiwlege in order to help my future children.</p>
    <p> I have had the wonderfull opportunity to be a member of the church of jesus christ of later days saint for my whole life. My favorite scripture is Luke 24:39 which just goes over
         Jesus ressurectrion.</p>
