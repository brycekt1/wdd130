      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The Idea and goal of this website is to allow the user to have the perception that they are viewing a professionally done website with enough vivid color to enchant their eyes. The website is designed to let people know how to responsibly nurture and take care of their new born puppy. During my time at Boise State University I have answered this same question for my communication class with effective accuracy. So when the time comes to pick up a new best friend you can rest assured that my website will nurture any problems you have.

         Have you walked by a cage full of cute puppies? Has the thought of “wow I should really get one” ever crossed your mind”? But in that moment you decline those thoughts because you self consciously think that you are not responsible enough or lack the mental fortitude to raise a puppy? I myself have had the wonderful blessing to take care of a precious Labrador retriever till the beginning and end of its life cycle. Owning a dog is not easy but learning how is super easy. In this website I will be talking about how to responsibly take care and nurture your puppy especially in the early stages when you acquire one. While I do this I will go over  and address the importance of training, proper diet and exercise.

      <h3>[Training]</h3>
      <p>
        Training your dog is an important fundamental for you and the dog's happiness. Canceling or not forgoing training with your puppy can cause an unstable relationship. 
        According to Bark Busters Home Dog Training “Misunderstanding of pack structure is often the cause of behavior problems. Dogs instinctively crave leadership and are keenly attuned to the discipline associated with it. However, if dogs don't sense leadership from owners, their instinct compels them to try to take charge, which can lead to behavior issues such as barking, pulling on the leash, jumping or even worse behaviors.” What this quote illustrates is that it's very hard for a dog brain to understand who is parent and master if it's not disciplined for behavior outburst. Furthermore, a dog develops as it grows if it is not accustomed to boundaries or rules then it will be harder down the road to quickly implement said boundaries and rules at a further date. 
        
        There is no reason for you as an owner to feel bad at disciplining or training your dog. A lot of times owners don't start training for their dog because they feel that their dog will grow to resent them during the training process.  The article goes on to explain this clash of thought by saying “Discipline and leadership are not enemies of fun. And in no way should training a dog inhibit his playfulness. But that doesn't mean there should be no rules for inappropriate behavior. In fact, providing your dog with consistent leadership and ground rules for behavior will make him feel more secure and relaxed and make for a more self-assured companion”.   This important truth helps future and current owners understand that their puppy will not hate them but instead will build a positive and healthy relationship with their animal.  The added bonus to this new found truth is training your puppy will make it feel a sense of calm and help it get accustomed to its new home if it does experience homesickness from wherever it came.

      <h3>[Health]</h3>
      <p>
        A proper diet for a dog is essential for positive growth and helping with existing allergies. The proper food will also give your puppy an added boost to its endurance and help it live a longer life span. An article done by ISPSA states “Better quality foods made with better quality ingredients provide a better quality of life. The result is fewer skin conditions, less itching, fewer ear
        infections, shinier coats, less inflammatory bowel disease, better muscling and muscle tone, stronger bones, more energy, better temperament and other immediate physical benefits of better nutrition. Dogs are happier and feel better overall.” What this article touches on is the importance of a proper diet can help cure skin conditions, improve hygiene and help them build more muscles.  In the last part of the quote it highlights that a quality food which relates closely with diet makes the dog feel more happier. This in turn will help it not be depressed or tired as you continue to feed the puppy its diet.  As we are moving along you are probably wondering “How do you choose this proper diet”. In the last section of the article it states “Depending on your pet it is important to talk with your veterinarian about what the food source such as the protein should be like red meat versus white meat or fish.  The key here is again ensuring that whatever the veterinarian recommended food is, that it be of a high quality and not have elements in it that may tax the body in a different way.” As we can read, we see  it's important to consult with your local veterinarian about food choices for your dog because they too want to see your dog evolve into a healthy adult. If you choose not to consult with your veterinarian about food choices pertaining to your puppy you do run the risk of your dog's health declining.
